    </p>

    <p class="text-md mb-4">
      Our modular prefab homes and cottages are built with the same care and attention to detail as traditional on-site construction, using only the highest-quality materials and techniques. Each home or cottage is custom designed to meet the specific needs and desires of our clients, with a wide range of customization options available.
    </p>

    <p class="text-md mb-4">
      All our cottages / homes are protected against any weather conditions. Our standard design can withstand heavy sun, winds up to 180 Kmph, heavy rainfall and snow load up to 2ft. The entire external surface of any structure is well protected by weather-proof membranes which makes it durable for years. With regular maintenance, the design life of our cottages / homes can be up to 50+ years.
    </p>

    <p class="text-md mb-6">
      Please note, we are not manufacturers of low-cost homes and specialize in the luxury segment only. Our homes & cottages can be compared with good quality European wooden cottages which are even more expensive than us and have less durability than ours.
